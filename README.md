# truck-run
HTML Canvas game build with JS as part of a Javascript daily challenge. 

#This project was made while I was studying at university as part of a 30 day JS challenge. On one of the days we were tasked with using JS alongside HTML canvas to create a game. I wanted to replicate the 2D side scrolling games I played when I was younger. Truck Run was my submission for the challenge and is just a simple 2D scroller where you drive a truck and try to get as far as possible without crashing!

#The daily challenge allowed me to understand a little bit more how HTML canvas works as well as improve on my JS abilities.
